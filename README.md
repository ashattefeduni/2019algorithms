## Welcome

Computers are becoming more capable all of the time. For example:

- IBM Watson wins the game show Jeopardy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P18EdAKuC1U)
- IBM's Deep Blue defeats grand master at chess [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJarxpYyoFI)
- AlphaGo beats two professional Go champions [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g)
- Libratus beats professional poker players [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgau2BKTHbk)

These computers use complex algorithms – sets of instructions – to solve highly complex problems. 



Who would have thought a computer could out-bluff a human? Let's fight back!
