## Algorithms and Design Thinking

Computers are becoming more capable all of the time. For example:

- IBM Watson wins the game show Jeopardy [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P18EdAKuC1U)
- IBM Deep Blue defeats grand master at chess [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJarxpYyoFI)
- AlphaGo beats two professional Go champions [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g)
- Libratus beats professional poker players [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgau2BKTHbk)

These computers use complex algorithms – sets of instructions – to solve highly complex problems. Spend a few minutes [reading this article about algorithms](https://blog.pandorafms.org/what-is-an-algorithm/) before working through the following activities.

### Human Against Machine

We're going to explore the concept of algorithms further by looking at a game called _Pins_. 

- Your instructor will spend a few minutes showing a demo of the game.

Who would have thought that a computer could out-bluff a human? Let's fight back!

Follow these steps:
- [Download and read the rules of Pins](docs/Pins.pdf)
- Find a partner to work with - two minds are better than one!
- Using the sticks your instructor has provided, play a few games against each other. One of you will be the human and the other will be the computer. You should alternate between who goes first in each game. Your goal is to determine if there is an algorithm you can use to win the game every time.
- Use the provided pens and paper to help find a solution and/or draw a visual model of your solution.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ashattefeduni/2019algorithms/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ashattefeduni/2019algorithms/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
